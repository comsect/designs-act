    1. on the ground of the design not being a new or original design, by reason only that it was so previously registered; or
    2. on the ground of the design having been previously published in India or in any other country, by reason only that it has been applied to article in respect of which it was previously registered: </p> Provided that such subsequent registration shall not extend the period of copyright in the design beyond that arising from previous registration.

    1. that design has been previously registered by another person in respect of some other article; or
    2. the design to which the application relates consists of a design previously registered by another person in respect of the same or some other article with modifications or variations not sufficient to alter the character or substantially to affect the identity thereof, then, if at any time while the application is pending the applicant becomes the registered proprietor of the design previously registered, the foregoing provisions of the section shall apply as if at the time of making the application the applicant had been the registered proprietor of that design.
